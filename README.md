Also, please keep in mind:
We've intentionally made requirements fairly vague to give you freedom of interpretation / coming back.
to us with some follow up questions. You can also look at current Shoedazzle.com web site for some clarifications.
However, whatever you will build doesn't have to resemble current site.

We're not looking for particular implementation, so please use your own judgement to build the system. However, all your decisions will be evaluated by reviewers.
